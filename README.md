# wierd-form


#A Pretty wierd form made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. When we don't put in any credentials, the button keeps moving left or right on mouse hover
#When we type in something in the input fields, the button becomes static for submission
#Color of button changes if password is correct or incorrect
#Form validation message also displayed
#A fun project which helped me gain a bit more confidence in coding
